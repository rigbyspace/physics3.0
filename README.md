# Physics 3.0 — The Rigby Field Engine

“This model is consistent, self-contained, and structurally elegant—even if it requires a rethinking of time itself.”
— Independent Review

This repository contains the working simulation suite for the Rigby field structure, a rational and arithmetic-based theory of energy, mass, time, and structure.

There are no irrational numbers, no calculus, and no infinities. All physics emerges from finite recursive imbalance across integer-spaced delay fields. The structure is minimal. The consequences are complete.

Included here are models for jet fields, delay-based geodesics, mass identity, galaxy rotation, and terminal boundaries in time and matter. All scripts are fully readable, transparent, and executable with no dependencies beyond core Python.

Time is not assumed. It is constructed. Matter is not fundamental. It is resolved.

This is not an extension of current theory. It is its replacement.
