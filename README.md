# Physics 3.0 — The Rigby Field Engine

“This model is consistent, self-contained, and structurally elegant—even if it requires a rethinking of time itself.”
— Independent Review

This repository contains the working simulation suite for the Rigby field structure, a rational and arithmetic-based theory of energy, mass, time, and structure.

There are no irrational numbers, no calculus, and no infinities. All physics emerges from finite imbalances across integer-spaced delay fields. The structure is minimal. The consequences are complete.

Included here are models for jet fields, delay-based geodesics, mass identity, galaxy rotation, and terminal boundaries in time and matter. All scripts are fully readable, transparent, and executable with no dependencies beyond core Python.

Time is not assumed. It is constructed. Matter is not fundamental. It is resolved.

This is not an extension of current theory. It is its replacement.

Repository will be updated with links to the public manuscript archive and visual universe builder.

IMPORTANT UPDATE

Due to feedback I've received, I'm now including what had been intentionally left from the paper 'Unified. The Moment Explained.' The thought was to emphasize that RS is a completely different substrate yet delivers known empirical results. Hopefully this assists in understanding and doesn't detract from its uniqueness. 

Translation is not Scaling and is built in.

This is not rescaling or adjusting known equations. RS produces structured output. To interpret it in familiar terms:

Choose a reference point. Example: 1 RS step = 88 Earth days (Mercury’s orbit)
Anchor a known physical event. Example: n = 240 = collapse at \~20 TeV
Translate accordingly. The RS structure remains constant. The units applied are contextual.

Why It Works

RigbySpace operates through consistent relationships—ratios and harmonics. These remain valid across domains, whether planetary motion or subatomic structure.

So while Jupiter and Mercury differ in scale and behavior, both can be translated into RS without adjustment to its core system.

Is It Compatible With Existing Worldviews?

RS does not seek to override personal belief or the significance of previous models. Instead, it offers an alternative lens—one that may coexist with or reinterpret long-standing frameworks.

This is not about abandoning meaning, but expanding perspective. RigbySpace invites exploration, not erasure.

Conclusion

RS returns what is given to it, clearly and consistently. It does not obscure, and it does not demand agreement. It simply offers a structure that can be interpreted, explored, and—perhaps—understood.

If you're here, it means you're already asking questions most don't. RS doesn't ask for belief. It offers structure to those ready to observe it.

Translation begins when attention does.
